# Supermarket-Management-Java

Certainly! Here's the translation of your description into English:

I developed a simple supermarket management and sales system using Java. The code includes the following classes:

Main: Coordinates a sales management system in Java, providing an interactive menu with options to register products, make sales, and exit the system. It uses control structures like switch-case to execute actions corresponding to each user choice, keeping the program running until the user chooses to exit.

Product: Represents a product with name, price, and stock quantity. It allows for sales transactions and updates the inventory.

Order: Models an order placed by a customer, consisting of multiple order items. Each item is associated with a product and the quantity ordered.

Customer: Stores basic information about a customer, such as their name.

OrderItem: Relates a specific product to the quantity ordered within an order.

Payment: Represents a payment associated with an order, including the total amount and the chosen payment method.
